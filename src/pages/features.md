# Features

Some of the features of OHMG include...

## Handle Complex Content

Multi-document items, like atlases, are first-class citizens, with full support for multiple maps on each sheet and multiple content scales across the atlas.

## Collaborative Model

An iterative, componentized workflow provides direct access for any user to contribute at any stage in the overall process.

## Seamless Mosaics

Margins are removed from adjacent map layers by creating a "multimask" across the entire item, rather than trimming each layer independently.

## Transformations & Projections

Backed by GDAL, any standard transformation algorithms can be used for GCPs, and any projection can be targeted.

## Web Services

Layers are immediately published as web services and can easily be integrated into third-party platforms, like OpenHistoricalMap and Felt. 

## Data API

A simple API can provide researchers with programmatic access to GCPs, cutlines, and GeoTIFF download links.
