# Documentation

Documentation is provided here to help you get around the platform ([Navigating the Site](/docs/category/navigating-the-site-1)) and use the tools ([Making the Mosaics](/docs/category/making-the-mosaics-1)).

There is additional information on the Sanborn Map company and the maps themselves, as well as links to the many other places people use and have written about them ([About Sanborn Maps](/docs/category/about-sanborn-maps-1/)). 

Finally, if you are technically inclined and/or want to use the mosaic layers in your own website or software, check out the [Technical Documentation](/docs/category/technical-documentation-1/).

For more newsy information, check out the [Blog](/blog).
